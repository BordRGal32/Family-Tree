Family Tree
===========

An Epicodus Project
-------------------

_Week 6, Day 5_
_Lauren Yeiser and Liz Tom_

This is a command-line app to track a family tree. It's an exercise in using Active Record without Rails, and playing around with associations that aren't always straightforward. We were given a small amount of code and had to build it out.

Here are the features I want you to build:

* Let users enter a person, and describe that person as the child of two people.
* Flesh out the user interface to show a list of people, and lets you choose one to see who they're married to and who their parents are.
* Show who somebody's grandparents and grandchildren are.
* Add support for siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc.
* Finally, add support for divorces, which may be almost as difficult in the database as in real life.

**Hint**: I did a bad job of modeling the relationships. My design is very inflexible and not DRY. You'll have to think about how to refactor it as you go.
